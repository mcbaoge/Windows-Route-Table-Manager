Windows Route Table Manager (exe version)
Overview

The Windows Route Table Manager is a simple and powerful graphical application designed to manage and modify the routing table of your Windows machine. This tool allows you to view, add, delete, and modify IPv4 routes directly from the user-friendly interface. The software is compiled into an executable .exe file for convenience, making it easy for users to manage routes without having to interact with the command line.

This project is distributed as a precompiled executable and does not include the source code.

Run the executable: Double-click the .exe file to start the application. You might be prompted to grant administrative privileges to allow the application to make changes to the system’s route table.

Usage

The software will automatically detect and list all existing routes on your system.

You can add new routes, modify existing ones, or delete routes using the available options in the interface.
